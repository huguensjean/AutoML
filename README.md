Model output tested on famous Mickey Mouse Show

![Mickey-Mouse Demo](demos/mickey-mouse.gif)

Model output tested on classic Wizard of Oz movie

[coming soon..]

Model output tested on Super Heroes (like Batman, Spider-Man, Super-Man, Captain America etc)
in popular Action & Sci-Fi films..

## Scripts in this directory :

	Detect-Character.py : Recognize popular tv / movie and cartoon characters..

	Usage:

		python3 Detect-Character.py VIDEO PROJECT_ID MODEL_ID

	In addition to input video file, this script takes Auto-ML Project ID and Model ID
        as input parameters. Once the model is trained and deployed in Google Cloud, simply
        pass the corresponding project and model IDs to run this script.

        If you like to use any of my pre-trained models deployed on GCP, please contact me
        so I can provide you the credentials to access APIs..

	Coming soon:  Scripts for running offline predictions using TensorFlow.JS
