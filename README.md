Model trained on popular Super Heroes in Action & Sci-Fi films..

[coming soon..]

### Scripts in this directory :

	Detect-Character.py : Recognize popular tv / movie and cartoon characters..

	Usage:

		python3 Detect-Character.py VIDEO PROJECT_ID MODEL_ID
	
	In addition to the input video file, this script takes Auto-ML Project ID and Model ID
        as input parameters. Once the model is trained and deployed in Google Cloud, simply
        pass the corresponding project and model IDs to run this script.

        If you need my help to build a custom model trained for specific movie / tv-show, 
	you can reach me at [amruta@cinematrix.in]

	Coming soon:  Scripts for running offline predictions using TensorFlow.JS / Docker
